# TradingBotUsingMACD

This code is an automated trading algorithm that uses the MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) strategy to buy and sell stocks.

It uses the yfinance library to download the financial data of a given stock for the period specified by the user. It also uses the ta library to calculate several technical indicators, such as the simple moving average (SMA50) and MACD, from the downloaded financial data.

The code also defines a "tradingstrategy" function that uses the MACD strategy to decide when to buy or sell stocks. If the conditions are met, the code performs a buy or sell transaction and records the dates of the transactions.

Finally, the code calculates the final outcome of the trade using the amount of shares and US dollars remaining at the end of the trade period. It also calculates the "Buy and Hold" result to compare the results of the automated trading strategy to buying and holding shares for the same period.
